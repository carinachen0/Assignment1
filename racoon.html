      Meet the racoon! Raccoons are medium-sized 16 to 28 inch long mammals native to North America. They are easily 
      recognized by the black markings across their eyes, their pointed snouts and bushy ringed  tails. Raccoons are 
      highly adaptable and intelligent animals that can thrive almost anywhere with enough water and food. They are 
      omnivores, eating basically anything: fruits, seeds, insects. They are cute and fluffy but often dubbed as 
      trash panda, as they are known to raid trash cans, raid vegetable gardens, and suspects of your damaged lawn 
      or property. Homeowners get headaches upon tracks of racoon activities and its a rightfully valid concern 
      since they are known to carry rabies and parasites. Clearly, they are a very resouceful seemingly harmless but dangerous bunch.

      Here are some racoon facts:
      <ul>
        <li>They have agile, sensitive and dexterious front paws allowing them to open trash cans and latches</li>
        <li>The myth that they wash their food before eating is false. In fact they are dousing, wetting their paws to increase
        sensitivity. That way they better understand what they are about to eat.</li>
      </ul>
