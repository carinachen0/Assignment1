      Meet the whale! Whales are large marine mammals found in all oceans throughout the world. 
      Their diets are based on their species type: baleen whale filter-feeding on other smaller
      marine mammals like krill and fish while while toothed whale feed on wider range like fish, 
      seal and squaid. Whales plays a very vital role in the ocean, not only redistributing nutrients
      but also maintaining the food chain balance.
