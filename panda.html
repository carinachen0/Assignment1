      Meet the panda~ also known as the ultimate bamboo enthusiast. These fluffy chubby black and white bears are native to China, where they spend at 
      least 12 hours a day eating bamboo and the other 12 hours being adorable. Munching on bamboos is more than a full time job!
      
      They are so beloved that they became the mascot and symbol of the WWF (and China). Their entire survival plan shouts "eat bamboo and hope for the best".
      With only about 2,500 left in the world, they are one of the most protected and cherished animals on the planet.
